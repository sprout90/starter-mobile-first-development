            <h2>Coffee Basics</h2>
            <p>
              Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the
              seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. It is darkly
              colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in
              humans, primarily due to its caffeine content.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries and is one
              of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and
              presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press,
              caff√® latte). It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a
              popular alternative.

            <h3>Dates back to 800 A.D.</h3>
            <p>
              Legend has it that 9th-century goat herders noticed the effect caffeine
              had on their goats, who appeared to "dance" after eating the fruit of
              the Coffea plant. A local monk then made a drink with the produce and
              found that it kept him awake at night, thus the original cup of coffee
              was born.

            <h3>Technically seeds</h3>
            <p>
              Coffee beans are technically seeds. They're the pits of the cherry-like
              berries found on the flowering shrubs, but we call them "beans" because
              of the resemblance to legumes.

            <h3>Banned in the past</h3>
            <p>
              Back in 1511, leaders in Mecca believed it stimulated radical thinking
              and outlawed the drink. Some 16th-century Italian clergymen also tried
              to ban coffee because they believed it to be "satanic." However, Pope
              Clement VII loved coffee so much that he lifted the ban and had coffee
              baptized in 1600.
