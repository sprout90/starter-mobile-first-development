# Mobile first development starter

## What is it?
A web page that was developed using mobile-first development.

## Why?
Provide practical application of mobile-first development techniques using flexbox and relative sizing to supporting varying screen sizes.

## My Focus
My focus as a student was to convert an existing page into a layout that is now visible in the page.

## ToDo
* Improve the centered images in 1st row to line up under the 'Perk Up Your Attention' title.
* Improve to first row to collapse into a single column for smaller screen sizes
